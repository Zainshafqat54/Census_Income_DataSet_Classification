# Census_Income_DataSet_Classification

## Introduction

This project aims to classify individuals based on their demographic information using the Census Income Data Set. The dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn

## Methodology

Two classification algorithms, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, are used in this project to classify the individuals into two classes: `<=50K` and `>50K`. The dataset is first preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Then, both algorithms are trained on the training set and their performance is evaluated on the testing set.

## Usage

To run the code, simply open the `Classification_using_the_Censu_ Income_DataSet.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in order.

## Results

The results of the classification will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook. The evaluation metrics used are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms for binary classification using the Census Income Data Set. The results can be used as a benchmark for further experimentation with different algorithms and/or feature engineering techniques.
